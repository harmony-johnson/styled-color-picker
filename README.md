A simple project designed to practice styled components.

Its a simple site with multiple sections that have their default styling. 

If a color is written into the input box, it changes the color of the corresponding element of the section (background or text) to the inputed color.

it accepts both hex, rgb and color names.

if a color isn't inputed or a non-existant color is inputed and change is clicked, it resets the color to the default values
